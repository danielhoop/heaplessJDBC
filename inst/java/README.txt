SQL Toolbox is a Command Line Interface (CLI) utility.
It is based on Java, so you need to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your machine in order to use it.
To see help, open your command line (e.g. cmd/Powershell on Windows or Bash on Linux).
  Type: java -jar "C:/path/to/SQLToolbox/SQLToolbox.jar"
  If you get an error like "The command java could not be found." the Java directory is probably not in you PATH variable.
  Then try something like: "C:/Program Files/Java/jre1.8.0_112/bin/java.exe" -jar "C:/path/to/SQLToolbox/SQLToolbox.jar"
  
  On Windows, try to execute the file 'Help_Windows.bat' which is located in this folder. It will show all options of the tool.
